# MarketPredictor

This project aims to predict future prices of S&P 500 stock and cryptocurrency based on analysis of both financia data and contemporary news articles surrounding the crypto space. For financial data we integrated API's from yfinance and libraries like matplotlib to visualize and graph the data. For news articles we fetched data from a New York Times API and used the VaderSentiment library to perform sentiment analysis to see whether certain articles would positively or negatively impact the price of crypto/stock. 

Much of this project revolves around training LLMs and data science in the world of finance which depicts the exact intersection that I am heavily passionate about. So throughout the project I gauged a greater understanding of how Artificial Intelligence can and will play a much bigger role in the world of finance especially with the rise of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
