Published late last year, \u201cThe Korean Cookbook\u201d by Junghyun Park, the chef at Atomix and others in New York, and Jungyoon Choi, a chef and writer, provides nearly 500 pages of comprehensive illustrated coverage of hansik, or Korean food culture. It surveys history, geography, vocabulary, techniques, ingredients, meal structure and the evolution of Korean food, all for the home cook, starting with fermentation and kimchi, bap (rice) and banchan, the other dishes arrayed on the table to elevate that simple bowl of rice. These include namul (vegetables), wraps, pancakes, broths, stews, dumplings, porridges and sweets. The point is made, repeatedly, that despite the ubiquity of beef in Korean restaurants in the West, notably short ribs, vegetables actually dominate the cuisine. There is a great deal to learn. The 350 recipes do not represent a personal collection but a textbook survey, with some simple treasures like superbly fresh raw fish bibimbap, japchae glass noodles, kimchi fried rice and cucumbers stir-fried with richly marinated beef, all calling for ingredients that are easy to obtain. Others are more challenging, requiring dried jujube, salted shrimp, chrysanthemum leaves and Korean pancake mix. (Possible substitutes are rarely suggested.) And with its focus on regional cooking, the book needs a map for those unfamiliar with Korean geography.",

There is also a counter service menu of viennoiseries, pizzettes and sandwiches like jambon beurre, tuna Ni\u00e7oise, and king oyster mushrooms with broccoli rabe and ricotta. The spacious kitchen has permitted the executive pastry chef, Michelle Palazzo, to expand her repertoire to more elaborate pastries, also being sold, like pistachio Paris-Brest and tarte au citron. The head baker is Peter Edris. This week, the bakery will become a full-service cafe with an expanded menu and table service. More substantial fare will include a warm black radish vichyssoise, tarte flamb\u00e9e, mushroom and Taleggio pizza, a roast beef sandwich, an omelette, rotisserie chicken salad, and duck confit with farro.

But I do appreciate learning about the people who made it, especially if they led interesting or unusual lives, and all the more so if those lives can illuminate aspects of the work. So it\u2019s a safe bet that, having started last year by reading Willa Cather\u2019s \u201cMy \u00c1ntonia,\u201d I\u2019ll spend some time at the beginning of this year with Benjamin Taylor\u2019s new Cather biography, \u201cChasing Bright Medusas,\u201d which Andrea Barrett\u2019s review calls \u201ca brief, clear introduction to Cather\u2019s life and work.\u201d That\u2019s on our reading list this week; why not add it to yours?",

These icebergs, some of them skyscraper-size, calve regularly from the glacier front, crash into a deep fiord and float west into Disko Bay. Then they drift out into the North Atlantic, break apart and melt. The intense activity here, as well its breathtaking location, have earned the area a designation as a UNESCO World Heritage site and made it a powerful attraction for Greenland\u2019s small but vibrant tourist trade.",

Nine years before this drawing was created, Duranty wrote something critical of Manet, in response to which Manet, encountering Duranty in a cafe, slapped him. Duranty demanded that Manet apologize. Manet refused. Duranty challenged Manet to a duel. The duel, by sword, took place three days later. Manet was unscathed; I guess you could say he won. Duranty, the man in the Degas drawing, \u201creceived a wound in his upper chest,\u201d as the museum text accompanying the drawing states matter-of-factly. I stared incredulously at the text\u2019s last line: \u201cSurprisingly, the two men remained friends after the incident.\u201d",

In Wassaic, N.Y., in the Hudson Valley, John Dyson is betting on the appeal of American single malts at his Tenmile Distillery. A former state Commissioner of Agriculture and Tourism who owns Millbrook Vineyards & Winery nearby and Williams Selyem winery in California, Mr. Dyson hired Shane Fraser, a master distiller from Scotland, to run the distillery. Their Little Rest Whisky, with whisky spelled as it is in Scotland since the distillery produces the spirit as is done in Scotland, is the second edition, recently released after a very limited first run. It\u2019s light bronze and scented of toast and honey, with notes of hazelnuts on the palate, and excellent to sip with or without ice. If terroir can shape a whiskey, this one evokes the gentle, welcoming Hudson Valley. The distillery also produces gin and vodka.",

        "lead_paragraph": "Beef or chicken? The restaurateur Simon Kim now has you covered either way. An owner of the Korean steakhouse Cote is opening what he calls a \u201cfried chicken cathedral,\u201d with a dining room framed by glowing, barrel-vaulted arches that disappear to infinity, thanks to a rear wall mirror. The design is by the Rockwell Group, involving David Rockwell\u2019s personal touch. But the food is Mr. Kim\u2019s idea, more than four years in the making, with the executive chef Seung Kyu Kim in charge (no relation to the owner, though the two met while working at Jean-Georges). Simon Kim\u2019s notion is to offer a mix of American and Korean approaches to fried chicken and give it glamour with (supposedly) more sustainable ingredients in a more elegant setting. At Coqodaq it\u2019s one-size-fits-all, a $38 dinner that includes chicken soup; a bucket of chicken parts fried in a gluten-free batter based on rice flour, chicken glazed with gochujang or soy and garlic; a cold perilla noodle dish; banchan, small dishes, that include palate-cleansing white radish; and soft serve frozen yogurt. Starters (extra) include some seafood options. The chickens are pasture-raised in Pennsylvania Amish country, and triple-fried in oil produced in Iowa from fermented Brazilian sugar cane. The name of the restaurant blends French, American and Korean words for chicken. The sommelier, Victoria James, who also curates the wines at Cote, has a wine list that features Champagne, which she and Mr. Kim agree is the ideal beverage for fried chicken. Her list offers 400 of them, and other sparklers by the glass and the bottle. Considering that fried chicken is finger-food, in the front of the restaurant, there\u2019s a hand-washing area with three sinks. Some high-top tables near the entrance are for walk-ins, there\u2019s a long bar, and garage doors will open to an outside patio in warmer weather. Tables at the leather-upholstered booths beneath the arches in the 190-seat room have lazy susans, the better for sharing. (Opens Friday)",

After retiring from football in 2020, he founded the design practice Studio K\u00ebr.

The collection reimagines objects of communal gatherings; pieces include the Gumbo lounge chair, a lush take on the stackable monobloc chair, and the Pew couch, a nod to the church bench, made of leather and ekki wood. \u201cFor me, the show is about celebrating Black ingenuity and connecting back to that African diasporic design language,\u201d says Bennett. \u201cWe Gotta Get Back to the Crib\u201d is on view from Jan. 12 through Feb. 10, marta.la.",

In \u201cLeo,\u201d Burr\u2019s Squirtle is the grouchy sidekick to Leo, a septuagenarian lizard (voiced by Adam Sandler). They share a terrarium in a fifth grade classroom in Florida, and when Leo realizes he\u2019s reaching the end of his reptilian life span, he has a sudden urge to escape and see the world. When the humorless substitute teacher Ms. Malkin (Cecily Strong) tells the students that they each have to take one of the two creatures home for the weekend to learn responsibility, Leo sees his chance. He goes home with the chatty Summer (Sunny Sandler), and reveals that he can speak. Once each kid stops freaking out about bringing home a talking lizard, Leo turns into a life coach/therapist for them. Through old-school wisdom, the children learn lessons about kindness, acceptance and confidence. The script \u2014 by Sandler, Robert Smigel (\u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d \u201cHotel Transylvania\u201d) and Paul Sado (\u201cSandy Wexler\u201d) \u2014 doesn\u2019t break any new ground, but there are enough cute jokes, so-so musical numbers and visual gags to hold the interest of preschool- and elementary-aged kids.

In 2021, Nahas\u2019s friend the French restaurateur Benjamin Pastor suggested they partner up to start a cafe and farm shop in the busy Marrakesh neighborhood of Gueliz. Last spring, they opened the coffee shop Blue Ribbon, with offerings including fresh salads served with halloumi or beets and almonds and a b\u00e1nh m\u00ed sandwich on fresh sourdough. In the fall, they added a seating area next door and the Slimane Farm Shop, which sells vegetables and products like honey and dried herbs that are grown and produced on the farm. Up next: Farmers, a restaurant headed by Blue Ribbon\u2019s chef and located in the same building. The 46-seat space, lined with colorful Popham tiles, is scheduled to open at the end of February. blueribbonmarrakech.com.",

Now he\u2019s looking ahead, to the 2024 election and beyond. Roberts told me that he views Heritage\u2019s role today as \u201cinstitutionalizing Trumpism.\u201d This includes leading Project 2025, a transition blueprint that outlines a plan to consolidate power in the executive branch, dismantle federal agencies and recruit and vet government employees to free the next Republican president from a system that Roberts views as stacked against conservative power. The lesson of Trump\u2019s first year in office, Roberts told me, is that \u201cthe Trump administration, with the best of intentions, simply got a slow start.

In a short video on Sunday, the Florida governor looked natty in a blue suit and red tie, every hair perfectly in place as he papered over his deeply imperfect campaign. He touted his leadership and, perhaps with an eye toward running again in 2028, endorsed the Republican kingmaker, Donald Trump. It wasn\u2019t a terrible performance, especially under the circumstances. But watching Mr. DeSantis\u2019s now-famous awkward smile and listening to his unnatural cadence, it was hard not to think: Yeah. I can see why this guy\u2019s candidacy is deader than disco.",

He was Chinese, and she felt connected to the particular set of pressures he faced. She read through old, anonymous course evaluations, looking for any sign she might have missed. But she was unsure where to put her personal feelings about a loss suffered in this professional context. What was the appropriate channel for processing, either with co-workers or students, the sorrow and fear that the death of a student inspired? Foo went on preparing for her fall classes. ",

They established their first, August Gatherings, in Chinatown nearly 10 years ago with a Cantonese menu that had some creative twists. This time, they\u2019re doubling down, adding additional global influences in a more formal setting and calling the food modern Cantonese. Mr. Leung, a native of Guangzhou who came to New York in 1988, pays homage with dishes like salt-baked chicken, several abalone preparations, fried rice with roasted eel, and Hong Kong style noodles with fish maw. But he will also be adding black truffles to his Cantonese shrimp dumplings, tossing octopus with fusilli, and using balsamic vinegar. Equipment like sous vide is also in his arsenal. \u201cI\u2019m preserving the integrity of Cantonese food but adding international ingredients and techniques,\u201d he said. Among the desserts, he has successfully crossed the classic Chinese egg tart with the Portuguese nata, a similar confection that\u2019s popular in Macau, and which he\u2019s been serving at August Gatherings. Michael Goff, the beverage director, has assembled a tight list that starts at $50 but, with an eye on Wall Street, climbs to a $2,000 Burgundy. The restaurant\u2019s fancy street entrance is next to the modest-looking Courtyard by Marriott, which houses the restaurant on its second floor. The large, airy, well-windowed space seating 168 in a main room and smaller private rooms, is fitted with banquettes and tables in quietly elegant tones of beige and salmon, with fake greenery and flowers and real Chinese ceramics.

The brand\u2019s Legacy Collection, which comes out on Feb. 1, revives five of Lauder\u2019s creations with the help of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle (whose perfume brand was acquired by the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies in 2015) and the perfumers Anne Flipo, Carlos Bena\u00efm and Bruno Jovanovic, all of whom have worked with Malle on previous fragrances. During an interview inside Lauder\u2019s well-preserved office near Central Park, Malle explained how he retooled the scents using more modern fragrance-making techniques. He noted that, in Lauder\u2019s day, perfumers combined base scents that were \u201clike premixed mini-perfumes\u201d to create a final fragrance. \u201cThey contained things that weren\u2019t necessary and created background noise,\u201d Malle said. To update the formulas, any nonessential ingredients in those bases were stripped away \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s like cleaning up,\u201d he said. The new collection has notes that range from fresh and herbaceous to musky and sweet. Azur\u00e9e, initially released in 1969, evokes dry Mediterranean shores with herby notes like basil and tarragon as well as jasmine, spicy cardamom, bergamot, and cumin, which Malle amplified in his edition. For White Linen, a classic floral bouquet of rose and jasmine, Malle used pure labdanum, an ambery resin from the rockrose plant, which wasn\u2019t available when the scent debuted in 1978. Knowing, a seductive scent from 1988, \u201ccontained a little bit of the Muzak of the \u201980s,\u201d Malle said. The modernized version is a fruity chypre with raspberries, black currant, rose and patchouli. The overall goal of the collection, Malle said, \u201cis to revive this work and show how good Mrs. Lauder was.\u201d The Legacy Collection is available from Feb. 1, $280, esteelauder.com.",
